WARNING:Place:1019 - A clock IOB / clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB /
   clock site pair. The clock component <u_infrastructure/u_bufg_clk125> is placed at site <BUFGMUX5>. The IO component
   <CLK125_P> is placed at site <L20>.  This will not allow the use of the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <CLK125_P.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
   The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that
   this error condition be corrected in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:777 - Incomplete DCM configuration. The DCM comp u_infrastructure/u_clk125/DCM_INST is set for
   variable phase shifting with CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT set to VARIABLE. Therefore the phase shift pins (PSINCDEC, PSEN and
   PSCLK) should have active signals in order to implement variable phase shifting, if this implementation is wanted.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 471 block(s) removed
 140 block(s) optimized away
 459 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
